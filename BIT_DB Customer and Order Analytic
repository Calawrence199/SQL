#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
Where Product='iPhone' 
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product,sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
Where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT COUNT(distinct customers.acctnum), AVG(quantity*price) as 'AmountSpent'
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FebSales
LEFT join BIT_DB.customers customers
On customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
